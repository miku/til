> The Next Generation Internet (NGI) is a European Commission (EC) initiative
> that aims to shape the development and evolution of the Internet into an
> Internet of Trust. An Internet that responds to people’s fundamental needs,
> including trust, security, and inclusion, while reflecting the values and the
> norms all citizens enjoy in Europe.

> After an initial EC investment in NGI research and innovation of more than
> €250m (2018-2020) that supported more than 1,000 Internet researchers and
> innovators involved in hundreds of projects, the EC announced renewed EU
> funding for NGI under Horizon Europe.
